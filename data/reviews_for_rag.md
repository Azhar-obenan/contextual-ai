### Jesse - ★☆☆☆☆ - 2025-03-30

Drove all the way from West to stand in front of a closed shop that seems to be renovated or permanently closed. We double checked maps and it said open. It takes seconds to change opening hours on Google my business

### rakel zetterlund - ★★★★☆ - 2025-03-16

Delicious food, a bit on the pricy side for brunch. Especially if you want to add something on (eg. Mushrooms) becaus the added portion is quite small. But overall the food and coffee was good!

**Response:**

Hi Rakel!

We're thrilled you enjoyed the food and coffee at FACTORY GIRL, and we appreciate your honest feedback about the pricing and portion sizes for add-ons. We'll take your comments on board as we're always looking to improve our brunch experience while maintaining the quality you've come to expect from us in Amsterdam.

I went to try shakshuka for the first time and I was not disappointed! I was the perfect food for a chilly day. The hummus on top was homemade as well and was delicious. Now I want to learn how to make it!

### Metissia Stinvil - ★☆☆☆☆ - 2025-02-27

I went back a few weeks ago the food quality went down the drain. They serve cheap juice from the supermarket as fresh orange juice, the dishes do not match the description, prices increased a lot, the staff seem tired and not willing to help. I would not recommend.

**Response:**

Hey Metissia, thanks for taking the time to share your feedback about FACTORY GIRL. We're genuinely sorry to hear about your disappointing experience and we'll definitely look into the issues you've raised, especially regarding the juice quality and menu descriptions.

### T Major - ★☆☆☆☆ - 2025-02-20

This was such a disappointing experience after reading such wonderful reviews about this place. Have had it on my list for a while so finally made my way and honestly, I would have had a much better breakfast at home than here. When I first walked in, the atmosphere was odd. No music and felt very clinical. Second, the coffee was not good. I ordered a latte and the espresso tasted weak. Could only really taste the milk. The biggest disappointment though was the food and the service. The menu had so many options but I was drawn to the Yosma because I love hummus and pilaki (beans) so much. I added two eggs and when the dish arrived it was so lacklustre. I started digging in and noticed there weren’t any beans. When I mentioned it to the server, she simply said “oh, we must be out.” Frustrating because I would have just ordered something else. She disappeared and then came back to confirm that yes, they were in fact out of beans. I told her it would have been nice to know as I would have ordered something else and she just stared at me and said “oh, sorry.” Then to top it off, when the bill arrived, there was no compensation for the missing item even though I had added two additional items. It was just a really dull experience for a place that has so much hype. Maybe if I had ordered something else, it would have out shined the incredibly mediocre service but you would hope that all dishes on the menu would be a excellent choice and leave you feeling happy with your decision.

**Response:**

Hey T, we're genuinely sorry to hear about your disappointing experience at FACTORY GIRL. We appreciate your detailed feedback and will use it to improve our service, menu accuracy, and overall atmosphere to ensure future visits meet the high standards our customers expect.

### abd01 - ★★★★☆ - 2025-02-12

I recently had the pleasure of trying factory girl, and it was absolutely fantastic! The flavors were perfectly balanced, and each bite was better than the last. The ingredients were fresh, and you could tell that a lot of care went into preparing the meal. The presentation was also top-notch, making it as enjoyable to look at as it was to eat. I especially loved [mention a specific element, like the seasoning, texture, or any unique aspect of the dish]. Overall, I highly recommend it and will definitely be coming back for more!

**Response:**

### Erdem Koçer - ★★★☆☆ - 2025-02-09

If you're looking for good food but bad service, this is the place. They are not acting nice when you have questions. Also we knew we had a few minutes on our reservation but they said we have to go in a bad manner.

I'd rather not be treated like this on a sunday but brunch.

### Iria Gonzalez Otero - ★☆☆☆☆ - 2025-02-03

In general pretty bad! First the waitress was super rude when taking our order, they messed up our order which we told them about and they 'fix' it just by adding a poached egg on top. To finish up, when we asked for the check it wasn't even what we ordered. In general pretty bad service, food is average! Would not recommend either will come back!

### Eliza S. - ★★★☆☆ - 2025-02-01

The food was good, we were greeted by a very sweet lady. But it took very long for someone to take our order, and then, to my disappointment, I ordered an apperol spritz, and it was served in a really tiny glass ( the smallest apperol I have ever had), with no ice. When I questioned the waitress, she said: we are out of ice, and just left. I believe the very least that could have been done was to inform me immediately when I placed the order, that the classic drink, would have no ice. In this case, I wouldn’t have ordered it. Also, the waitress left so quickly, I didn’t have a chance to return the drink. Such a shame.

**Response:**

Dear Eliza, we sincerely apologize for the disappointing experience with your Aperol Spritz and the service at FACTORY GIRL. We appreciate your feedback and will address these issues promptly to ensure better communication and service quality in the future.

### Rhy - ★★★★★ - 2025-01-28

Went here just after getting off an overnight flight, desperate for a filling vegan breakfast. Was slightly worried it would be an an overpriced, hyper-trendy kind of spot - couldn't be further from reality. It brought us back to life. It's aesthetic is modern but comfortable and unique. More importantly, the food is SO GOOD and the portions are very satisfying! We kept going back for that shakshuka!! And for the very friendly, welcoming staff. Thank you, factory girl!!

**Response:**

Dear Rhy, we're absolutely thrilled that FACTORY GIRL exceeded your expectations and provided such a memorable experience. We're delighted our vegan breakfast and shakshuka brought you back to life after your flight, and we truly appreciate your kind words about our staff and atmosphere.

### Maerlin Ellis Diem - ★★★★★ - 2025-01-24

A gem of a brunch place!

The food is fantastic (regardless of savoury or sweet - but if you don't treat yourself to the daily flavour of coco anjela, are you even living?), the atmosphere is both cosy and cute as well as stylish without being pretentious, and the service is efficient and lovely.

Extra plus-point: Factory Girl also has some of the best music we've heard in Amsterdam when brunching, a perfectly crafted mix of lyrical, ambient and jazzy at just the right volume.

Make sure to reserve your table at least a day in advance - Factory Girl has made the excellent choice to go with a more spacious table set-up, which ensures that you don't feel crowded when salivating over the digital menu. It really contributes to the chill vibe if you have some privacy and fewer voices to talk over each other that comes with the sardine-like seating arrangements found in too many Dutch cafes.

All in all, this is a place that you'll love so much that you won't even mind getting on a 20min bike ride through a rainy, windy, below-zero-January day for, because it's really just THAT GOOD.

Needless to say, we're gonna be back. <3

**Response:**

Dear Maerlin, we're absolutely thrilled by your glowing review of FACTORY GIRL! Your detailed appreciation of our food, atmosphere, and service truly warms our hearts, and we're delighted that you enjoyed the music and spacious seating arrangement. We can't wait to welcome you back for more delicious brunches and cozy vibes.
