### Jesse - ★☆☆☆☆ - 2025-03-30

Drove all the way from West to stand in front of a closed shop that seems to be renovated or permanently closed. We double checked maps and it said open. It takes seconds to change opening hours on Google my business

Dear Jesse,
Thank you for your feedback and for bringing this issue to our attention. 
We updated the relevant information across all channels immediately, weeks ago, and have double-checked on multiple devices to ensure that only the correct information is displayed. Unfortunately, sometimes it is necessary to clear the cache on personal devices to access the most current information. Despite these precautions, I am very sorry to hear about the inconvenience you experienced due to the changes. We truly appreciate your understanding and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future. If you ever visit Berlin, we would be delighted to host you at our location there.

### rakel zetterlund - ★★★★☆ - 2025-03-16

Delicious food, a bit on the pricy side for brunch. Especially if you want to add something on (eg. Mushrooms) becaus the added portion is quite small. But overall the food and coffee was good!

**Response:**
